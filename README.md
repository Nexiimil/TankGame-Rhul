# Final Year Project - Buidling a Roguelike Video Game

Currently, this project can only be played within the Unity Editor, to do so, clone this repository, and Download the Unity Editor for your system. Open a project folder, which can be found in the Unity Work folder, either the prototype, or one of the many proof of concepts. Proof Executables are indeed standalone executables, however, I believe they are windows exuctables only.

Movement is controlled with standard WASD, and rotation of the player and its gun turret can be controlled with the Left and Right Arrow keys. Shooting is with the Space Bar.
