# Final Year Project - Building a Roguelike Video Game

This project has two methods of being ran:

## Via Windows Executable (Recommended):
In the compressed zip (.zip) file that was submitted to moodle, there will be a windows executable that can be run found in the the root of the zip

There is also an unzipped version of the same files.

Via the Github Repository you will find an identical zip file to the one submitted on Moodle in the root of the Github repo.

## Via Unity Editor (Not Recommended):
Note: Unity editor is not required to READ the code, just to RUN it. (VSCode will do to read the code, which is located within one of the many project files, the location of which is noted below)

In order to run the final release of the game via the Unity Engine, you will need:

- Unity Hub
- Unity Editor (Which can be downloaded via Unity Hub)

Clone the repository, and in Unity Hub, Click: 

Open > Add project from disk

Then navigate to the location of the cloned repo, and in the directory 'Unity Work' you will see a few folders containing many unity projects. Navigate into one of these folders, select and open one of the projects. This will be added to Unity Hubs main screen, double click it to run. It may ask you to install the respective version of Unity Engine, which you must do to run the game.

Once the project opens, there will be a play button in the middle of the top of the screen, which should allow you to play the game.
