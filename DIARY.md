# Project Diary - Building a Game
## 28/09/2022
This diary has been created to keep myself in line with my goals, as well as actually being able to outline them here over time. Currently, i have:
 - A project plan draft with all the key sections
 - This repo cloned for editting .md files in VSCode
 - Some small collection of papers/books/games for reserach and analysis
 - A proof of concept for auto-tiling rooms correctly in Unity
 - A loose game design document
 - ideas i havent writen out, which im gonna do below

What i am doing right now:
 - The second draft of my project plan, tuning back the abstract, because its a page long
 - Figuring out how i want to format this diary
 - Getting unity to work with this gitlab repo

Final goals:
 - A game with some form of PCG, a character to navigate with, and enemies to defeat
 - A detailed report on all the complexities of the above task, especially noting all the ==Design Patterns==
